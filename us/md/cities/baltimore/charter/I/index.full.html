Any such extension may be provided only if other municipalities or sections of the United States shall have made such a change, and in the opinion of the Mayor and City Council thereby have caused inconvenience and annoyance to the commercial, economic, industrial or social affairs of the residents of Baltimore City.</p>

                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p class="text-indent-">Ordinance 24-318, known as Ballot Question F, which was ratified on November 5, 2024, enlarged the permitted acreage for development within Inner Harbor Park from 3.2 to 4.5 acres. In addition, the Ordinance added multi-family dwellings and off-street parking to the list of permitted uses within this development space, but any land occupied by those two uses would no longer be part of the public park. Section 2 of the Ordinance states "[t]hat in enacting this Resolution of the Mayor and City Council, it is the intent of the Mayor and City Council to preserve the public park known as Rash Field and to preserve the existing development restrictions within the Inner Harbor Park south of Conway Street."</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-"><strong>Litigation related to Ballot Question F.</strong> A group of 23 Baltimore City voters filed a petition for judicial review of Ballot Question F in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County alleging that Ballot Question F was invalid because (1) it was improper "charter material" in violation of Article XI-A, § 3 of the Constitution of Maryland and (2) the language of the question was not "easily understandable by voters" in violation of § 9-203(1) of the State Election Law Article, in addition to other claims. After the circuit court found that the measure could be included on the ballot but the votes for or against it could not be certified, the decision was appealed to the Maryland Supreme Court. The Supreme Court of Maryland issued a per curium order dated October 10, 2024, permitting the votes for or against Question F to be counted and certified.</p>
