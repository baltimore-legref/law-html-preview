If, by virtue of the grant, the plant and property are to become the property of the City without money payment therefor, the City shall have the option either to take and operate the said property on its own account, or to renew the said grant for not exceeding twenty-five years on a revaluation or sell the same to the highest bidder at public sale.  If the original grant shall prescribe that the City shall at its election make payment for such plant and property, such payment shall be at a fair valuation of the same as property, excluding any value derived from the franchise or right and if the City shall make payment for such plant and property, it may, in that event, operate the plant and property on its own account for five years, after which it may determine either to continue such operation on its own account or to lease the said plant and property and the said franchise or right to use the streets, or other public property in connection therewith, for limited periods, not to exceed twenty-five years from the date of the grant, under such rules and regulations as it may prescribe, or to sell the plant and property to the highest bidder at public sale.</p>

The grant shall also specify the mode of determining the valuations and revaluations which may be provided for therein.</p>
