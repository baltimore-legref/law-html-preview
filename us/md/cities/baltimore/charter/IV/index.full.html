                  <h3>Editor's Notes</h3>
                  <p class="text-indent-">§ 9-113 of the Local Government Article (enacted as former Article 24, § 1-108, by Chs. 8 and 9, Acts of 1999) provides that “a candidate for chief executive officer [of a county] shall be a resident of the county for at least 6 months before the general election for chief executive officer” {LG §9-113(c)}.  By constricted definition and scope, however, this requirement applies to but two “counties” (Baltimore City and Montgomery County) and two “chief executive officers” (the Mayor of Baltimore City and the County Executive of Montgomery County) {LG § 9-113(a) and (b)}.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-">The section further provides that a “county” may retain a Charter-imposed residency requirement that is longer than 6 months if that political subdivision “reaffirms the requirement by enactment of an Ordinance effective no later than 4 weeks before the filing deadline specified in § 5-303(a) of the Election Law Article” {LG § 9-113(d)}.</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-">In response to these provisions, the Mayor and City Council enacted Ordinance 99-433, effective June 1, 1999, to “reaffir[m] and retai[n] the residency requirement for Mayor that is imposed by <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/cities/baltimore/charter" title="Charter of Baltimore City">the Baltimore City Charter</a>”.</p>
                  <p>Subsection (d) was added by Initiative Ballot Question K, ratified November 8, 2022.  The final sentence of Question K establishes that subsection (d) will be effective “beginning with persons elected in the 2024 Baltimore City Election.”</p>
