                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p class="text-indent-">The preceding provisions were initially enacted by Section 1 of Chapter 753, Acts of 2018.  Section 4 of that Act provided for these provisions to become effective from the date of their enactment – i.e., May 15, 2018.  Section 4 further provided that “Section 1 of this Act shall remain effective for a period of 1 year and 8 months and, at the end of 1 year and 8 months from the date of enactment, Section 1 of this Act, with no further action required by the General Assembly, shall be abrogated and of no further force and effect.”</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-">Chapters 459 and 460, Acts of 2019, rewrote <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/cities/baltimore/charter/II/(71)#(h)" title="">subsection (h) of this section</a> and amended subsection (m) to extend by 1 year the due date for the Commission’s final report.  These 2019 Acts also amended Section 4 of Chapter 753 to extend its “sunset” provision to “2 years and 8 months” from the date of the original enactment.  </p>
