                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(a)(1)">(1)</span> The York Road Corridor is a 2-mile long strip of commercial development that serves as a linear collection of at least 3 principal nodes focused on major crossroads intersections (Belvedere Avenue, Woodbourne Avenue, Cold Spring Lane), which serve the local commercial/retail needs of their adjoining neighborhoods to the east and west.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(a)(2)">(2)</span> In many ways the York Road market area is now split by the road itself.  To the west are very affluent residential neighborhoods with high residential values.  To the east are more modest neighborhoods with lower residential values, homeownership rates, and household incomes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(a)(3)">(3)</span> The York Road Corridor can and does serve as a meeting ground for all adjoining neighborhoods and commercial uses that can achieve their highest potential when they appeal to all consumer households.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)">(b)</span> <span class="level-heading">Needs and opportunities facing the District.</span></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)(1)">(1)</span> The York Road Corridor and Vision Action Plan of 2015 identified a variety of needs and opportunities facing the York Road Corridor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)(2)">(2)</span> According to the Plan:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)(2)(i)">(i)</span> Household spending within the York Road Market Area is estimated at $265.9 million annually, and spending on food and drink is estimated at $29.9 million.  These estimates do not include spending by the area's sizeable student population.  It is also estimated that the Area presently captures only 29.8% of that total spending, with the remaining spending going to businesses elsewhere.  This disposable income in the local corridor marketplace would be captured within York Road with an expanded mix of appropriate businesses and services to meet the on-going needs of the local community.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)(2)(ii)">(ii)</span> Given its largely built-out nature, the York Road Corridor operates within multiple constraints as regards to the attraction of new commercial/retail development opportunities.  In particular, land parcels along York Road are typically small, shallow, and in multiple ownership; arduous assemblage of parcels is typically required to accommodate the needs of many retailers.  There are few larger (2+ acre) parcels along York Road, and none are vacant land.  Over time the York Road Corridor will manage its real estate resources in such a way that uses along York Road will better serve the Market Area population, by attracting retailers who will serve unmet demand and by upgrading underutilized properties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/9-1#(b)(3)">(3)</span> Recommendation of the Plan:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2">Establishment of a York Road Business Improvement District (BID) is recommended as the management entity for the Corridor.  In order to advance and ultimately achieve its full potential, the Corridor will profit from active management – a group specifically tasked to supervise day-to-day operations (e.g., sanitation, safety/security), but also tasked with longer-term, strategic efforts such as working with existing businesses to help them succeed, improving the business mix to grow sales, marketing the corridor to new businesses, and capturing real estate development opportunities as they occur.  The BID structure (as codified in State of Maryland and Baltimore City authorizing legislation) is focused on commercial issues, deriving its revenues principally from a mandatory assessment on commercial property owners, thus dedicating its attention to improving the Corridor's business environment.  The BID will also derive operating revenues from fee-for-service arrangements and grants from City government, foundations, etc., to provide various services that are better delivered locally.</p>

Many cannot satisfactorily compete with new facilities that offer convenience, adequate parking, pleasing physical environment, diversification of retail services, and a management system that provides for promotional activities and for enhanced sanitation and security services.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/11-2#(c)(2)">(2)</span> Retail sales in these neighborhood shopping areas have decreased, and the loss of revenue has caused a gradual disinvestment in the commercial properties, vacancies and, in the worst cases, abandonment by property owners.  This disinvestment negatively affects the surrounding residential community, results in the loss of jobs and property taxes to the City and requires the City to assume responsibility for these properties.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1">To counter this trend Baltimore City established the Commercial Revitalization Program.  Selected neighborhood shopping districts were targeted for public improvements which would enhance the physical appearance of the area.  In return, retail merchants and commercial property owners were required to rehabilitate their properties in conformance with a unified design developed for the area.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/11-2#(e)(2)">(2)</span> The Commercial Revitalization Program has always been founded on self-help by the business community.  The merchant associations in neighborhood business districts are voluntary organizations of business persons who have limited time to plan and implement a management program and limited capacity to raise funds.  They have indicated to the City a strong need for such a management program and fund raising mechanism.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/11-2#(e)(3)">(3)</span> The management program created in this subtitle will harness the energies of the business community and provide it with the necessary funding through a Retail Business District License Fee.  Furthermore, the proposed program will enable all business establishments within the boundaries of a given Retail Business District to join in promotional, sanitation, and public safety efforts not economically feasible for many individual businesses without a program of this sort.  The City Council finds that this program serves a public purpose and enhances the general welfare of the citizens of Baltimore City.</p>

This activity generates $290 million in taxes and fees to the City of Baltimore annually, revenue that supports valuable City services, while also saving each Baltimore household $680 in annual personal tax contributions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/14/20-2#(b)(2)">(2)</span> Tourism is a major employer in Baltimore, creating or sustaining more than 85,000 jobs for City residents and across the region each year.</p>

This organization has been historically under-resourced in an increasingly competitive tourism market.  For example, market research quantifies a lack of overall awareness about and interest in Baltimore as a preferred tourism destination.  These challenges can be addressed through increased sales and marketing activities.</p>
