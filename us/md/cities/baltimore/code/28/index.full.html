                  <p>Subsection (a) was amended by Ordinance 20-336 {“Water Accountability and Equity Act”} to add an exception for certain water and wastewater bills.  That Ordinance was enacted on January 13, 2020, but with a delayed effective date of July 13, 2020.  Subsequently, Ordinance 20-468 {“Water Accountability ... Act – Modifications”}extended the effective date for this exception to Jan, 13, 2021.  See Editor’s Note in City Code <a class="internal-link " href="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/24" title="Article 24 Water">Article 24 {“Water”}</a>, at the end of that article’s Subtitle 2 {“Bills”} – especially the quote there from Ord. 20-468, Sections 3 and 5(e)(5).</p>

                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p>This section was enacted by Ordinance 19-290 and became effective on August 29, 2019.  Ord. 19-290 proposed to codify this section as a new § 10-31 but, for various reasons, the section is better codified here, adjacent to two preexisting tax credits for “high-performance” structures.</p>
                  <p>This section was amended by Ordinance 21-027, effective June 14, 2021, among other things, to revise the definition of “newly constructed dwelling” and to clarify and extend the credit qualification deadlines for certain high-performance newly constructed dwellings.  Section 3 of that Ordinance provides: “[I]f settlement on the purchase of the high-performance newly constructed dwelling occurred prior to the enactment of this Ordinance {i.e., June 14, 2021} and if the building permit for the construction of the ... dwelling was issued on or after July 1, 2019, but before July 1, 2020, an application for a tax credit under ... this Ordinance must be filed no later than December 31, 2021.”</p>
                  <p>By authority of Ordinance 20-431, Section 5, the Director of Legislative Reference, in consultation with the Law Department, has conformed this section to refer expressly to and reflect the requirements of the recently-enacted Administrative Procedure Act that, effective January 15, 2021, governs the proposal, adoption, and publication of administrative rules and regulations.</p>

                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p class="text-indent-">This subtitle was enacted by Ord. 99-388, effective July 1, 1999.  Section 3 of that Ordinance provides that the subtitle  “shall remain in effect unless the Maryland General Assembly enacts a Statewide tax on tobacco products; if a Statewide tax on tobacco products becomes effective, this Ordinance is abrogated and of no further force and effect, with no further action required by the Mayor and City Council.”</p>
                  <p class="text-indent-">After the enactment of Ord. 99-388, the General Assembly enacted Chapter 121, Laws of Maryland 1999.  Section 1 of that Act increases the rate of the preexisting tax on cigarettes; Sections 2 and 3 of the Act impose a new tax on certain other tobacco products.  Section 9, in turn, provides that Section 1 (the cigarette tax increase) becomes effective July 1, 1999; Section 8, on the other hand, provides that Sections 2 and 3 (the new Statewide tax on other tobacco products) only become effective July 1, 2000.</p>
