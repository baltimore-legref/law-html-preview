                <p class="text-indent-1">Costs of conducting electoral campaigns have increased significantly in recent years.  Many candidates are forced to finance their campaigns by seeking large contributions from individuals and entities who thereby gain disproportionate influence over governmental decision once the candidate holds office.  Qualified candidates without access to personal wealth or wealthy donor networks are often dissuaded from seeking public office.  Those that do run find it difficult to win with their voices drowned out in the media and on the ground.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1">Perception of the inappropriate and disproportionate influence on government by those monied donors who dominate campaign financing has led to disillusionment among city residents who have felt that their voices are not heard.  This disillusionment has resulted in disengagement from the political process and government.</p>
