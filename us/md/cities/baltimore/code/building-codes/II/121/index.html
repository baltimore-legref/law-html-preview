                <p class="text-indent-3">A receiver may foreclose on the lien by a sale of the property at public auction, following 1 public notice and notice to interested parties in the manner of a mortgage foreclosure.  After deducting the expenses of the sale, the receiver must apply the proceeds of the sale to the liens against the property, in order of priority.  In lieu of foreclosure, and only if the receiver has rehabilitated the property, an owner may pay the receiver's costs, fees, including attorney's fees, and expenses or may transfer all ownership in the property to either the receiver or an agreed-on third party for an amount agreed to by all parties to the receivership as being the property's fair market value.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1">Following court ratification of a sale, the receiver must sign a deed conveying title to the buyer, free and clear of all liens, judgments, and other encumbrances.  On court ratification of the sale, any secured interest of a lien holder or judgment creditor automatically attaches to the proceeds from the sale, to the extent those proceeds are available under § 121.10.3 {"Application of sale proceeds"}.</p>
