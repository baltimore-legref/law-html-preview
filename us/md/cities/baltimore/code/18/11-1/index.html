                <p class="text-indent-">Whereas, the members of the Art Museum Building Commission, including the Mayor, the President of the City Council and the City Comptroller, have been elected directors and trustees of said The Baltimore Museum of Art, Incorporated, and this lease is a plan formulated pursuant to said Ordinance.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-">Fifthly: That the library, apparatus and collections, and all other property of the said party of the second part which shall or may be placed in said building, shall continue to be and remain absolutely the property of said party of the second part; and the said party of the first part shall not, by reason of said property being placed in said building, or continuing therein, have any right, title, property or interest therein; nor shall the said party of the second part, by reason of its occupation and use of said building under this agreement, acquire, or be deemed to have any right, title, property or interest in said building, except so far as expressly granted by this agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-">Sixthly: That the said party of the second part shall, on or before the first day of May in every year during the continuance of this agreement, submit to the said party of the first part, its successor or successors, a detailed printed report of the operations and transactions of the said party of the second part, and all its receipts and payments, for the year ending with the thirty-first day of December next preceding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-">Seventhly: That the said party of the first part shall have, at all times, access to every part of said building for general visitation and supervision, and also for the purpose of the performance of the duties devolved upon it by the laws of the State of Maryland, or ordinances of the City of Baltimore.

                <p class="text-indent-">Ninthly: And it is further expressly understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto, that this Agreement may be wholly cancelled and annulled, or from time to time altered or modified, as may be agreed in writing between the said parties or their successors, anything herein contained to the contrary in anywise notwithstanding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-">In witness whereof, the party hereto of the second part has caused this Agreement to be executed by its President and Secretary, and its corporate seal duly attested by its Secretary, to be hereunto affixed, and the party of the first part has caused these presents to be signed by the Mayor, and its corporate seal duly attested by its City Register to be hereunto affixed.</p>
