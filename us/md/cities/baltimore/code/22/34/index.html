                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(u)(1)">(1)</span> Distributions under this subtitle shall be made in accordance with a reasonable good faith interpretation of Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9), as applicable to this System. This subsection is intended to comply with a reasonable good faith interpretation of Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(9) to the extent applicable to this System, and may not be interpreted to impose any requirements on this System or on any member or beneficiary of this System beyond those required to comply with a reasonable good faith interpretation of § 401(a)(9).  This subsection only specifies the latest permissible time by which distributions must begin and the longest permissible period over which distributions may be made, and in no way precludes any earlier commencement or more rapid distribution provided for in this subtitle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(u)(2)">(2)</span> Distribution of a member's retirement benefit shall begin no later than the April 1 following the calendar year during which the member both has reached age 70½ and has terminated employment with the City.  Distribution shall be made over a period not extending beyond the life of the member or the joint lives of the member and his or her beneficiary.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(u)(3)">(3)</span> If a member dies before distribution of his or her retirement benefit begins, the member's entire benefit shall be distributed within 5 years after death.  This requirement is deemed satisfied by any distribution of the member's benefit payable to his or her designated beneficiary over a period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary, as long as those distributions begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the member's death.  However, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date on which the distributions are required to begin is December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½.  This paragraph (3) does not apply if distribution of the member's benefit began before his or her death and the remaining portion of the member's benefit is distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the member's death.  Any amount paid to a child is treated as if it had been paid to a surviving spouse if that amount is paid to the surviving spouse when that child reaches the age of majority.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2">The annual compensation of each member taken into account under this subtitle shall not exceed the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") annual compensation limit.  The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, adjusted for cost of living increases under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</p>
