                <p class="text-indent-1">In addition to the benefits provided for in this subtitle, any beneficiary who becomes eligible for periodically paid retirement benefits as a result of the death of a retired member, which death occurs on or after July 1, 1977, and which member was retired and receiving benefits on or before June 30, 1977, shall be entitled to receive an increase in the total retirement benefits including §§ 6(n) and 6(o) adjusted increases, starting with the 1<sup>st</sup> full pay period on or after July 1, 1979 (or if the retired member dies after July 1, 1979, then the 1<sup>st</sup> pay period after the retired member's death), in an amount equal to 5% of the total retirement benefits including §§ 6(n) and 6(o) adjusted increases, which said beneficiary was receiving on June 30, 1979 (or at the time of the retired member's death, if later), subject to a maximum increase of $130 a year.  However, such maximum increase of $130 shall be reduced, pro rata, by each year and the decimal proportion of a year that the original member retiree's service was less than 30 years, at the time of the original member's retirement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1">The increases provided for under this section shall not be applicable to any retired member or any beneficiary of a deceased retired member who received a lump-sum benefit instead of a periodically paid retirement allowance.  In addition, the benefits provided for in this section shall cease at the time that the retired member dies, or the deceased retired member's beneficiary shall no longer be entitled to receive a periodically paid pension, annuity, or both, under any other section of this subtitle.  It is further provided that the increases under this section when so discontinued, shall not be reinstated upon any subsequent reemployment and subsequent eligibility for retirement as a result of such reemployment.</p>
