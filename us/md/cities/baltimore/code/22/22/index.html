The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</p>
