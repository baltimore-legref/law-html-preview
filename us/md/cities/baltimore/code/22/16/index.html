To obtain such credit the member shall file claim therefor with the Board of Trustees within 6 months after December 1, 1975, and shall pay to the Retirement System by a single payment or by an increased rate of contribution, as may be approved by the Board of Trustees, the contributions, with regular interest, which he would have paid had he been a member of the Employees' Retirement System of the City of Baltimore or the Maryland State Retirement System while such pre-enrollment or pre-membership employment was rendered, and that this payment shall be completed at least 90 days before the effective date of the member's retirement.  After December 1, 1975, those existing employees who are not members of the Retirement System and who join after December 1, 1975, shall be entitled to make application to purchase any pre-enrollment or pre-membership employment credit during the period expiring 6 months after becoming a member.  All persons who become new employees of the City of Baltimore after the effective date of this ordinance shall not be entitled to any credit for pre-enrollment or pre-membership employment if they have failed to join the Retirement System within 6 months of entering such employment.  Any pre-membership or pre-enrollment payments which have in the past been recorded for a member as service credit under the Retirement System shall continue to be recognized as service credit entitling the member to all of the benefits under this subtitle.</p>
