The review shall be sought and heard as provided for in the Maryland Rules, with the exception that the review shall be heard on the record only, on a right-of-way basis.  The final determination of the hearing examiner is presumptively correct and may not be disturbed on review except when arbitrary, illegal, capricious, or discriminatory.  A party to the judicial review may appeal the court's final judgment to the Court of Special Appeals in accordance with the Maryland Rules of Procedure.</p>
