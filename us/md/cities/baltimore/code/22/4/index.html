In the case of former members of the General Assembly of Maryland who become or who have become members of the Retirement System, each full year of membership in the General Assembly shall be credited as a year of service, regardless of whether payment for such service was on a per diem or per annum basis.  In any event, a member who vacated or otherwise relinquished his position as a member of the General Assembly before the end of the term for which he was elected, shall be given full credit up to the date of his separation from this position, regardless of whether payment for such service was on a per diem or per annum basis.</p>
