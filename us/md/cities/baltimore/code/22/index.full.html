The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</p>

Should there be a deficit in the Paid-Up Benefit Fund, the Board of Trustees shall transfer assets from the Contingency Reserve Fund to the Paid-Up Benefit Fund in order to offset such deficit, notwithstanding that such transfer creates a deficit or increases an existing deficit in the Contingency Reserve Fund.

It is intended that any such benefit increase shall continue for the lifetime of the eligible member and any beneficiary, consistent with any option elected under § 6 or § 9.  The foregoing Contingency Reserve Fund has been established to insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases for any year in which the Paid-Up Benefit Fund does not meet its interest assumption.</p>

In the event of any conflict between § 10 and/or § 42 and this section, the terms of this section shall prevail.</p>

An equal percentage reduction shall be made to all benefits granted under this section regardless of when such increases were granted.  If the Paid-Up Benefit Fund and the Contingency Reserve Fund should become exhausted or decline in value to the point of having no value, previously accrued increases shall be eliminated in full.  Any excess investment earnings available under subsection (c) above in a subsequent year shall be used to provide an increase in benefits without regard to any prior reduction or elimination of benefit increases previously accrued.</p>

This requirement is deemed satisfied by any distribution of the member's benefit payable to his or her designated beneficiary over a period not extending beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary, as long as those distributions begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year of the member's death.  However, if the designated beneficiary is the member's surviving spouse, the date on which the distributions are required to begin is December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½.  This paragraph (3) does not apply if distribution of the member's benefit began before his or her death and the remaining portion of the member's benefit is distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution being used at the date of the member's death.  Any amount paid to a child is treated as if it had been paid to a surviving spouse if that amount is paid to the surviving spouse when that child reaches the age of majority.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2">The annual compensation of each member taken into account under this subtitle shall not exceed the federal Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 ("OBRA '93") annual compensation limit.  The OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000, adjusted for cost of living increases under Internal Revenue Code § 401(a)(17)(B) and subject to the fresh start provisions set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.  The cost of living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period not exceeding 12 months over which compensation is determined (the "determination period") beginning in that calendar year.  If a determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period and the denominator of which is 12.  If compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's retirement benefit in the current year, the compensation for that prior determination period is subject to the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit for that prior determination period.  For this purpose, for determination periods beginning before July 1, 1994, the OBRA '93 annual compensation limit is $150,000.</p>
