                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> For increases determined as of or before June 30, 1995, each member who has retired from active service, whether before or after the effective date of this ordinance, and each beneficiary of a deceased member who is or will be receiving periodic retirement benefits, whether before or after the effective date of this ordinance, and who receives periodic benefit payments for 2 or more years may be eligible for an increase in such periodic benefit determined according to this § 17.  Such 2-year period shall be calculated commencing with the effective date of the 1<sup>st</sup> retirement benefit payment paid to either the retired member or the beneficiary of a deceased member and shall be determined on June 30 of each year commencing with June 30, 1983.  Years retired as a beneficiary of a former retired member shall include the years that the member was retired.  Eligible members and beneficiaries are also referred to herein as "persons".</p>

Eligibility for this increase shall be calculated commencing with the effective date of the 1<sup>st</sup> retirement benefit payment paid to either the retired member or the beneficiary of a deceased member and shall be determined on the June 30 determination date of each year, commencing with June 30, 1996.  A beneficiary of a former retired member is eligible to receive any percentage increase under this section that the retired member was eligible to receive.

                <p class="text-indent-2">As of the end of each fiscal year, a determination shall be made of the amount of increase (if any) of retirement benefit payments which may be payable to eligible persons.  The amount of retirement benefit increase shall be calculated with reference to excess investment earnings of the Annuity Reserve Fund and the Pension Reserve Fund only, and according to the method described in subsection (c) below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2">After determination of the amount of excess investment earnings available for retirement benefit increases, such excess investment earnings shall be allocated to eligible retired members and beneficiaries according to the following method.  The percentage which the benefits shall be increased shall be determined by the actuary as the amount that the investment earnings determined in subsection (c) below would be sufficient to fund on a single premium paid up annuity basis using the actuarial valuation assumptions on the June 30 preceding the effective date of the increase.</p>

A percentage factor will be determined by the actuary to increase benefits to those eligible.  The percent increase in an eligible member's or beneficiary's benefit will equal the percentage factor times full years which the member or beneficiary has been receiving benefits.  No fractional years will be used.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(iii)">(iii)</span> The allocation method set forth in paragraph (ii) above shall apply only until the following benefit increase objectives have been met:</p>

Each item below except for item (ii) under this subsection (c) is determined as of each June 30 beginning with June 30, 1983, and any benefit increase shall become effective as of the following January 1.

The Contingency Reserve Fund shall serve as a reserve to insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases for any year in which the Paid-Up Benefit Fund does not meet its interest assumption.

The Paid-Up Benefit Fund shall be funded with excess investment earnings consistent with subsection (c) above.  For any year in which the investment return of the Paid-Up Benefit Fund exceeds the interest assumption on which the purchase of paid up benefits is based, such excess shall remain in the fund and thereby help insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(iii)">(iii)</span> Prior to June 30, 1993, the Contingency Reserve Fund shall be a reserve to insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases for any year in which the Paid-Up Benefit Fund does not meet its interest assumption.  Should there be a deficit in the Paid-Up Benefit Fund, the Board of Trustees shall transfer assets from the Contingency Reserve Fund to the Paid-Up Benefit Fund in order to offset such deficit.  The Contingency Reserve Fund shall be funded with excess investment earnings consistent with subsection (c) above.  For any year in which the value of the Contingency Reserve Fund is equal to or exceeds 2½% of the Annuity Reserve Fund and the Pension Reserve Fund, earnings on the Contingency Reserve Fund shall be applied by the Board of Trustees in such amount or amounts as they determine (1) to decrease the amount contributed by the City of Baltimore and/or (2) to decrease the period over which the unfunded accrued liability will be amortized.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(d)(iv)">(iv)</span> On and after June 30, 1993, the Contingency Reserve Fund shall be a reserve to insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases for any year in which the Paid-Up Benefit Fund does not meet its interest assumption.  In addition, the Contingency Reserve Fund shall be used to provide the minimum benefit consistent with § 17(c) above.  Should there be a deficit in the Paid-Up Benefit Fund, the Board of Trustees shall transfer assets from the Contingency Reserve Fund to the Paid-Up Benefit Fund in order to offset such deficit, notwithstanding that such transfer creates a deficit or increases an existing deficit in the Contingency Reserve Fund.

Furthermore, while the Board is empowered to invest and reinvest such funds in any class of investment set forth at § 7, the Board is specifically empowered to invest and reinvest the Paid-Up Benefit Fund and/or the Contingency Reserve Fund in the medium of paid up annuity contracts or guaranteed investment contracts purchased from one or more insurance companies, provided that any such insurance company shall have no less than the highest rating from A.M.

It is intended that any such benefit increase shall continue for the lifetime of the eligible member and any beneficiary, consistent with any option elected under § 6 or § 9.  The foregoing Contingency Reserve Fund has been established to insure payment of previously accrued benefit increases for any year in which the Paid-Up Benefit Fund does not meet its interest assumption.</p>

On and after June 30, 1993, the granting of any benefit increase under the provisions of this section shall be subject to the minimum benefit provided for in § 17(c).  The continuation of any benefit increase previously accrued under this section is specifically made contingent on the ability of the Paid-Up Benefit Fund and the Contingency Reserve Fund to provide such benefits in the future.  § 10 and § 42 to the contrary notwithstanding, any benefit increase provided under this section shall not become an obligation of the City of Baltimore.  In the event of any conflict between § 10 and/or § 42 and this section, the terms of this section shall prevail.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(e)(iii)">(iii)</span> If the performance of the Retirement System's investment funds causes a decline in the value of the Paid-Up Benefit Fund and the Contingency Reserve Fund, with the result that full benefit increases previously accrued under this section cannot be continued, then the Trustees can reduce or eliminate previously accrued increases on an equal percentage basis, effective as of January 1 following the June 30 on which a deficit exists.  An equal percentage reduction shall be made to all benefits granted under this section regardless of when such increases were granted.  If the Paid-Up Benefit Fund and the Contingency Reserve Fund should become exhausted or decline in value to the point of having no value, previously accrued increases shall be eliminated in full.  Any excess investment earnings available under subsection (c) above in a subsequent year shall be used to provide an increase in benefits without regard to any prior reduction or elimination of benefit increases previously accrued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> Any retired member or beneficiary who began receiving periodic retirement benefits prior to June 28, 1991, shall receive a 3% increase in periodic benefits effective July 1, 1992.</p>
