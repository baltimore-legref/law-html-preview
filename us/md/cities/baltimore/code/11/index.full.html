                  <h4>Editor's Notes</h4>
                  <p>This subtitle was enacted by Ordinance 14-221, effective August 13, 2014.  The Ordinance proposed to designate the new subtitle as Subtitle 14, comprising § 14-1 et seq.  However, because <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/md/cities/baltimore/code/11" title="Article 11 Labor and Employment">this article</a> already contains a Subtitle 14, with sections similarly numbered, the new subtitle is codified here as Subtitle 15, comprising §§ 15-1 through 15-16.</p>
